```
Oh, you think you wanna start shit?
I ain't even from this world
Just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole
Just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned
Yeah
Push myself to my limit's
I'm in it to win it forget the beginning
It's now that you're livin'
Don't be forgiving
Don't fear what you're missing
A mind like a killer, you need to be driven
Ten steps ahead, you prepared in the head?
Think this shit through or
Just wing it instead
I'm tired of working so hard for this bread
I'm hungry as fuck and fucked up in the head
I'm sick of these lazy bums
They all get nothing done
Waiting to have someone take care of everyone
I don't need anyone
This shit ain't any fun
It takes hard work to make yourself a penny
Son and I will not be the one with regrets
And I will not hear the doubts or the threats
And I'm not one to ever forget
So, watch the fuck out or
I'm coming for you next
Oh, you think you wanna start shit?
I ain't even from this world
Just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole
Just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned
Yeah oh, you think you wanna start shit?
I ain't even from this world
Just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole
Just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned
Yeah
It's been, like, driving me crazy
These people complacent
Too many are lazy but wanna see changes
You can all hate me
You're slaves to these wages
You need to be crazy to
Head out for greatness
Don't want excuses, I wanna see movement
Just watch like a student and
See how they do it
Need some improvement, we all need solutions
So be the one who can just sack up and do it
You ain't never gonna stop me
I'll be found
Claw my way to the top, like a rebound
I'ma be the one to pop for the new sound
I'ma be the one to drop MC's now
I'm 'bout to go off in
The hill with this shit
Think that I'm lost but I'm
Found in this bitch
Think that I'm not what I say that I is
Think that I got what they need when I spit
Uh
Oh, you think you wanna start shit?
I ain't even from this world
Just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole
Just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned
Yeah oh, you think you wanna start shit?
I ain't even from this world
Just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole
Just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned
Yeah
